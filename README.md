# NLP--Fake-news-Classification

The Naive Bayes MultinomialDB algorithm can be used to classify news articles as real or fake. To do this, a large dataset of labeled news articles would be gathered and the algorithm would be trained on a portion of the data. The algorithm uses the frequency of words in the articles to determine the probability that each article is real or fake. Once trained, the algorithm could be used as a tool by journalists and fact-checkers to quickly and accurately classify news articles, helping to combat the spread of fake news and promote a more informed society.
